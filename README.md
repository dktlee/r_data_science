# R for Data Science Handbook
## Import, Tidy, Transform, Visualize, and Model Data

This repository stores the notebooks and projects I worked on while following the <em>R for Data Science Handbook</em> by Hadley Wickham & Garrett Grolemund (O'Reilly). 


Concepts:
- Wrangle - tranform datasets into a form convenient for analysis
- Program - learn powerful R tools for solving dat a problems with greater clarity and ease
- Explore - examine data, generate hypotheses, and quickly test them
- Model - provide a low-dimensional summary that captures true "signals" in datasets
- Communicate - learn R Markdown for integrating prose, code, and results
