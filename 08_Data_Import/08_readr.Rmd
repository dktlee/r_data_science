```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

read_csv("a,b,c
         1,2,3
         4,5,6")
```

Use read_csv / read_csv2 over base R read.csv because its faster, produces tibbles, and doesn't convert character vectors to factors.

```{r write_csv}
write_csv(challenge, "challenge.csv")

```
